# Lively
New Repository for Project 1

### User Story

As a music listener 

I want to know artist top tracks and similar artist

So I can listen to song I love but also want to discover new artist at the same time.

### Description 

This application works by having the user enter a artist name and Lively makes 5 different api calls from 2 sites; https://www.last.fm/api/, and https://tastedive.com/read/api. The first three calls from last.fm api get artist Bio, Top Tracks, Top Albums, and the last call tastedive gathers images for each artist.
